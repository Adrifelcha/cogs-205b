%% What Are Anonymous Functions?
% An anonymous function is a function that is not stored in a program file,
% but is associated with a variable whose data type is function_handle.
% Anonymous functions can accept inputs and return outputs, just as
% standard functions do. However, they can contain only a single executable
% statement.
%%
% For example, create a handle to an anonymous function that finds the
% square of a number:
sqr = @(x) x.^2;

%%
% Variable sqr is a function handle. The @ operator creates the handle, and
% the parentheses () immediately after the @ operator include the function
% input arguments. This anonymous function accepts a single input x, and
% implicitly returns a single output, an array the same size as x that
% contains the squared values.

%%
% Find the square of a particular value (5) by passing the value to the
% function handle, just as you would pass an input argument to a standard
% function.
a = sqr(5)

%%
% Many MATLABÂ® functions accept function handles as inputs so that you can
% evaluate functions over a range of values. You can create handles either
% for anonymous functions or for functions in program files. The benefit of
% using anonymous functions is that you do not have to edit and maintain a
% file for a function that requires only a brief definition.
%%
% For example, find the integral of the sqr function from 0 to 1 by passing
% the function handle to the integral function:
q = integral(sqr,0,1);

%%
% You do not need to create a variable in the workspace to store an
% anonymous function. Instead, you can create a temporary function handle
% within an expression, such as this call to the integral function:
q = integral(@(x) x.^2,0,1);

%% Variables in the Expression
% Function handles can store not only an expression, but also variables
% that the expression requires for evaluation.
%%
% For example, create a function handle to an anonymous function that
% requires coefficients a, b, and c. 

a = 1.3;
b = .2;
c = 30;
parabola = @(x) a*x.^2 + b*x + c;

%%
% Because a, b, and c are available at the time you create parabola, the
% function handle includes those values. The values persist within the
% function handle even if you clear the variables:

clear a b c
x = 1;
y = parabola(x)

%%
% To supply different values for the coefficients, you must create a new
% function handle:

a = -3.9;
b = 52;
c = 0;
parabola = @(x) a*x.^2 + b*x + c;

x = 1;
y = parabola(1)

%%
% You can save function handles and their associated values in a MAT-file
% and load them in a subsequent MATLAB session using the save and load
% functions, such as

save myfile.mat parabola


%% Functions with No Inputs
% If your function does not require any inputs, use empty parentheses when
% you define and call the anonymous function. For example:

t = @() datestr(now);
d = t()

%%
% Omitting the parentheses in the assignment statement creates another
% function handle, and does not execute the function:

d = t

%% Functions with Multiple Inputs
% Anonymous functions require that you explicitly specify the input
% arguments as you would for a standard function, separating multiple
% inputs with commas. For example, this function accepts two inputs, x and
% y:

myfunction = @(x,y) (x^2 + y^2 + x*y);

x = 1;
y = 10;
z = myfunction(x,y)

%% In-Class exercise
% Write an anonymous function to calculate the *exponential distribution*:
% 
% $$x \sim \mbox{Exp}(\lambda) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad p(x|\lambda) =
% \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$
% 
%%
% Then, use the anonymous function you just made as part of a new anonymous
% function to calculate the *standard exponential distribution*:
% 
% $$x \sim \mbox{StdExp}() \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad p(x) = e^{-x}$$
% 
%%
% Then, read the MATLAB documentation for |fplot| and see if you can do
% anything with it here.
