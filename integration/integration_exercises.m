%% Exercise 1
% Use the trapezoidal rule to calculate the area of the circle with center
% (0,0) and radius 1.
%%
% Hint:  $y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ is the top half of that circle.


%% Exercise 2
% Suppose I have taken pictures of a distant star and measured the diameter
% each time.  My measurements fluctuated a bit:  on average the diameter is
% 1.234 Tm, with a standard deviation of 0.091 Tm (normally distributed).
% Use Gauss-Hermite quadrature to calculate the expected value of the
% *volume* of the star.
%%
% Hint: The volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
%%
% Extra credit:  This is a real star.  What is it called?
