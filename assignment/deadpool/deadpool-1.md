# Report: Mean and Covariance matrix of the input data usin class Norm2d 

Date:                                                       16-Feb-2021 18:09:33  

This report was generated using the data matrix (size 2 x N) from the input. The mean vector and covariance matrix are obtained from the functions **estimate_mean** and **estimate_covariance** in the **Norm2d** class respectively.
### The estimated quantities are:
- Mean( X<sub>1</sub> ) = 1.019
- Variance( X<sub>1</sub> ) = 18.216 

- Mean( X<sub>2</sub> ) = 0.960
- Variance( X<sub>2</sub>) = 21.570 

- Covariance( X<sub>1</sub> , X<sub>2</sub> ) = 8.603 

- Correlation( X<sub>1</sub> , X<sub>2</sub>) = 0.434
