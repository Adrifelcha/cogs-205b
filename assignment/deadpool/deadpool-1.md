Date:                                                       16-Feb-2021 17:23:53  #

This report was generated using the data matrix from the input. The mean vector and covariance matrix are obtained from the functions **estimate_mean** and **estimate_covariance** in the **Norm2d** class respectively.
### The estimated quantities are:
- Mean( X<sub>1 , X<sub>2 ) = ( 1.019440, 0.960170 )
- Variance( X<sub>1 ) = 18.216428 

- Variance( X<sub>2 ) = 21.570068 

- Covariance( X<sub>1 , X<sub>2 ) = 8.602962 

- Correlation( X<sub>1 , X<sub>2) = 0.434001
