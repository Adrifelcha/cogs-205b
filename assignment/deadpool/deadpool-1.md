Date:                                                       16-Feb-2021 17:13:37  #

This report was generated using the data matrix from the input. The mean vector and covariance matrix are obtained from the functions **estimate_mean** and **estimate_covariance** in the **Norm2d** class respectively.
### The estimated quantities are:
- mean = ( 1.019440, 0.960170 )- Covariance =  18.216428, 8.602962 
- Covariance =  8.602962, 21.570068
